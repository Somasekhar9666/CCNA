signal floding ----> switch sends to other nodes in network except Source node


**broadcast Domain: 

        *A broadcast domain includes all devices that receive a broadcast message sent by any device in that domain.
        
        A broadcast is a message sent to all devices in the network (e.g., ARP request).
        
        *Routers do not forward broadcasts between different networks, so they create broadcast domain boundaries.

        ðŸ“Œ Example:
            Scenario: A network with switches and a router

            If you have multiple devices connected to a switch, they are in the same broadcast domain.
            If a router is placed between two switches, it separates the broadcast domains.
            
            ðŸ”¹ Diagram:

                        [PC1] â”€ [Switch] â”€ [PC2]  (Same Broadcast Domain)  

                        [PC1] â”€ [Switch] â”€ [Router] â”€ [Switch] â”€ [PC3]  
                        (Different Broadcast Domains because of the Router)
        
        So Routers define broadcast domain boundariesâ€”not just the network itself.


Router will not supoort any broadcast , so router is the end point for broadcast P3

Each interface ofa router is in diffrent broascase domain **************** P5
