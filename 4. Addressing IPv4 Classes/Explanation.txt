IANA-----Intenet Assigned Numers Authority ----> Assigns IP Address


Ipv4  -->   32 bit  address 

             DDN ---> Dotted Deimal Notation 


Ipv6   --> 128 bit address


------------------------------IPv4----------------------------
32 bits are devied into 4 parts are called as Octect 

    10001100  .  11110000 . 00001111 . 00101010

    140       .   252    .    63     .   241


The each octect can range from  0 to 255(only in this , *if 256 means its wrong IP)

    min value: 00000000   -------->  0

    max value :11111111   ---------> 255




* The IP address consists of two Portions : 


                                            Network Portion                                                                                     Host Portion

                        * Network portion defines which Network the IP belongs                                                      * Host Portion defines the Individual Machine 







Classification of Ipv4 Address:(*Based on 1st Octect*)


        if first octect is in :
                                    1   ------  126          :         Class A


                                         (127 is skipped ) ------->  loop back address


                                    128  ------  191          :         Class B


                                    192  ------  223          :         Class C 


                                    224 ------   239          :         Class D    ------->  reserved for Multi casting  (all sales can be one group and assign this adddress)


                                    240  ------  255          :         Class E    -------->   reserved for R & Data




*Network  Portion Vs Host Portion : 

        Class A:

                                            Ex:   126.1.5.10


                            -->  the first octect is Network Portion 

                            -->  remaining octects are  Host Portion 



                                            126                   .               1                 .        5                     .              10 

                                            Network                               Host                       Host                                  Host
                            



                            So         8 bits are for Network 
                                    
                                       24 bits are for 
                                       

    🤔 Why This Separation?

            *The separation between network and host is used to:

                Route data: Routers use the network portion to figure out where to send packets.

                Identify devices: The host portion identifies specific devices within that network.

            So in your example:

                126 tells us which network (like a street address)

                1.5.10 identifies the device (like a house number)



        Class B:                            
                            -->  the first octect is Network Portion 

                            -->  remaining octects are  Host Portion 



                                                Ex:  135           .         189        .           155          .              134

                                                    Network                Network                  Host                        Host
                                                


                            SO  
                                       16 bits are for Network 
                                    
                                       16  bits are for Host




        Class C:                            
                            -->  the first octect is Network Portion 

                            -->  remaining octects are  Host Portion 



                                                Ex:  193           .         200        .           205          .              222

                                                    Network                Network                  Network                     Host

                                       8  bits are for Host








*Subnet Mask:
            🧠 What is a Subnet Mask?
                        A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that is used with an IP address to distinguish:

                                                                                                        Which part of the IP address refers to the network

                                                                                                        And which part refers to the host (the device on the network)


            It is a 32 bit value           (consists of 32 0's and 1's)   


            In Subnet Mask, Network portion is denoted by all 1's  and the Host Portion is denoted by 0's 

                   Subnet mask of class A is :   
                                                    N            H          H         H
                                                11111111  .  00000000 . 00000000 . 00000000       -----------(Convert to Decimal)---->       255 . 0 . 0 . 0


                
                   Subnet mask of class B is :   
                                                    N            N          H         H
                                                11111111  .  11111111 . 00000000 . 00000000       -----------(Convert to Decimal)---->       255 . 255 . 0 . 0



                   Subnet mask of class B is :   
                                                    N            N          N         H
                                                11111111  .  11111111 . 11111111 . 00000000       -----------(Convert to Decimal)---->       255 . 255 . 255 . 0





        🧱 Example:
                Say you have an IP address:
                                            192.168.1.10

                And a subnet mask:
                                    255.255.255.0

                The subnet mask is like a "filter" that says:

                                                            "The first 3 parts (192.168.1) are the network, and the last part (.10) is the host(Device)."




        📌 Why is it called a "subnet mask"?
                                                Let’s break the term down:

                                                Sub = "subdivision" → it helps divide a big network into smaller ones (called subnets).

                                                Net = "network" → you’re working with network addresses.

                                                Mask = like a filter → it masks the IP address to hide the host part and reveal only the network part.

                                                So the subnet mask "masks" the IP address to extract the network portion

        


        🎯 Main Purpose of a Subnet Mask
                                        🔹 1. Identify the network and host parts of an IP address.
                                        This is essential for routing:

                                                    Routers need to know if a destination is on the same network or not.

                                                    They use the subnet mask to make that decision.



                                        🔹 2. Divide a large network into smaller subnets.
                                        For example:

                                                    A company has 192.168.1.0/24 (256 addresses)

                                                    You can divide it into 4 subnets of 64 addresses each using subnet masks like 255.255.255.192





Network Address : 

                The network address is the identifier of the entire network. It is not assigned to any individual host (computer, router, etc).

                Instead, it represents the "name" of the network that all hosts belong to.

                Think of it as the postal code for a neighborhood — it's not the address of a specific house, but the area as a whole.
                            
                n--------> n  (not 255 )

                H-------->0

                            Ex: 126 .1.5.10                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                
                                    In Class A last 3 octects are Host portion so                                                                    Ex:  135.189.155.134(Class B):          
                                                                                    126 . 0 . 0 . 0                                                                                 135 . 189 . 0 . 0     



                🧭 Why is it called network address?
                                                    Because it identifies the network that the IP address belongs to.

                                                    It's used by routers to know where to send packets.

                                                    All devices with IPs like 126.10.20.30, 126.1.2.3, etc., with subnet mask 255.0.0.0, are in the same network: 126.0.0.0.

                                                    This address tells routers:

                                                                            "If the destination IP starts with 126, send it to this local network."       



                🛑 Can the Network Address Be Assigned to a Host?
                                                                    No. The network address is reserved and cannot be assigned to any device.

                                                                    Just like:

                                                                                In a street, house number 0 is not used — it's reserved to refer to the street itself.

                                                                                Same here: 126.0.0.0 refers to the entire network, not any device.                                   



Broadcast address : 

            
                    A broadcast address is a special IP address used to send a message to all devices on a network (subnet) — at once.

                    It’s like saying:

                    “Hey everyone in this network, please listen to this message.”

                    🧠 Key Rule:
                    Every subnet has one unique broadcast address.

                    It’s the highest address in that subnet (all host bits set to 1).



                    If you want send something to all machines in network. we can use this adddress  
                    
                    "Sending updates to every studnts of a class ---> "Hey Students , tommorow is a Holiday" 

                    n----------> n

                    H----------> 1

                    Ex: 126 .1.5.10

                                    In Class A last 3 octects are Host portion so                                                               Ex:  135.189.155.134(Class B)
                                                                                    126 . 255 . 255 . 255                                                                   135 . 189 . 255 . 255

                                                                        “Who has IP 192.168.1.5? Tell me your MAC address!”

                                                ✅ The ARP request is sent to the broadcast address:
                                                                                                    192.168.1.255

                                    This way, all devices receive the message, but only the one with IP 192.168.1.5 responds.

                                    Without a broadcast, the computer wouldn't be able to discover other devices on the network.


                    


                    🔥 Visual Analogy
                                        Imagine you walk into a room (a subnet) and shout:

                                        “Who is John? Please come to the front!”

                                        That’s a broadcast — everyone hears you, but only John responds.
                                        The broadcast address is how that shout is delivered on the network.



                    ❌ Can Broadcast Addresses Be Assigned to a Device?
                                                    No — broadcast addresses are reserved.

                                                    You cannot give a device the IP 192.168.1.255 (if you're on a 255.255.255.0 subnet) because:

                                                    That address is reserved for sending messages to everyone.

                                                    Giving it to one device would break the network behavior.
