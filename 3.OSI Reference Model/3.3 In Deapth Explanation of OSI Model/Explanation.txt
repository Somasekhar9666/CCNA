To give you a clear understanding of how data flows through all seven layers of the OSI model, let’s use a simple example of sending a text message—for instance, "Hello"—from Machine1 (Sender) to Machine2 (Receiver). We will explain the operations that happen at each layer, both on the sender’s and receiver’s side.

    The OSI Model Overview:
        
        Each layer is a "Package of Protocols" which decides the folow of Data in the network to maitain seamless Commmunication
            
            The OSI Model has seven layers:

                        Application Layer
                        
                        Presentation Layer
                        
                        Session Layer
                        
                        Transport Layer
                        
                        Network Layer
                        
                        Data Link Layer
                        
                        Physical Layer






Sender Perspective:

        1. Application Layer (Layer 7)

                Application layer is used Network Applications --> Comouter Applications that use Intenet like Chrome , Firefox, outlook , webex....

                Browsers use HTTP/HTTPS to do web surfing 
                
                outlook and Gmail uses SMTP to Mail  transfer  , FTP for file transfer......

                there are Dozens of Application layer Protocols that enables variious funtions in this Layer
                    
                **The Application Layer Provides Services for Network applications with help variious Application layer Protocols to perform User Activities
                    
                Operation:
                            The application on Machine1 (sender) prepares the message "Hello" (the data).
                            
                            The application then passes the data to the Presentation Layer for further processing.
                            
                            Example: When you type "Hello" in a messaging app, that text is generated at the Application Layer.
        


        2. Presentation Layer (Layer 6)
                    
                    Role: The Presentation Layer is responsible for data formatting, encryption, and compression. It ensures that the data is in a format that the recipient can understand (e.g., ASCII, UTF-8).
                    
                    Operation:
                            Machine1’s Presentation Layer takes the raw data ("Hello") and may apply encoding, compression, or encryption depending on the application's requirements.
                            
                            For instance, if the message is in UTF-8 encoding, it will be converted into its byte representation.
                            
                            If encryption is required (for security), the message "Hello" may be encrypted into something like 9a74adf42f... (a ciphertext).
                            
                            The data is passed down to the Session Layer.
                    
                    Example: If the message "Hello" is encoded into UTF-8, the text will be transformed into a sequence of bytes (e.g., 72 101 108 108 111 for each character).

        

        3. Session Layer (Layer 5)
                       
                        Role: The Session Layer manages the session between two communicating machines, ensuring the communication is established, maintained, and properly terminated. It handles session management (start, maintenance, end).
                        
                        Operation:
                                    Machine1’s Session Layer sets up, maintains, and terminates the session between the sender and receiver.
                                    
                                    If multiple messages are exchanged, the Session Layer ensures data is properly organized and synchronized.
                                    
                                    After establishing the session, the data (still "Hello") is passed down to the Transport Layer.

                                    *Session layer Has its own helpers , those are  API's ,NETBIOS

                                    *Server uses Autionication to Identify the user BEFORE  creatring the session

                                    Autirazition also perfomed  by session Layer
                        
                        Example: If you are chatting with someone in real-time, this layer ensures that both sides stay synchronized and manage the session of your chat.




        *4. Transport Layer (Layer 4)
                        
                        Role: The Transport Layer ensures reliable data transfer by providing flow control, error handling, and segmentation. It breaks the data into smaller units called segments.

                                                                                    or

                        Transport Layer controls the Reliabiity of communication through :

                                                    Segmentation 

                                                    Flow control 

                                                    Error control

                            
                                Segmentation : Break Down of Incoming Data into smaller Data units callaed Segments
                                              
                                               Each Segment contains:
                                                     Source and destination  port Numbers so that it correctly go its respected application ---> like Whatsapp , facebook, insta , gmail...

                                                     a Sequance Number  --> to form or re-assemble correct order in the reciver side
                                
                                Flew control: 

                                        Controls the Data flow rate b/w the session  to make sure that the no data loss

                                Error Control:
                                  
                                        if some data is not arrived at destination , TS layer uses Automatic Repeat Request  to get the  lost data

                                        also it adds some checksum to each segment to ensure the trasmission 
                                

                        Ex Protocols are : TCP and UDP


                        Transport Layer perfoms two kinds of  services :

                                    1. Connection -Oriented trasmission ------------------> TCP 

                                    2. Connection Less trasmission --------------------> UDP 
                        


                        *UDP  is faster than TCP , because UDP does not provides any Feedback  wheather the data is really Delivered , while  TCP Provides Feedback sothat lost data is re-transmitted

                        UDP is used where wheather we have recived old data -----> songs , movies , games , voice over IP  TFTP , DNS 

                        TCP: full data delivery is must  ---> www , meail ,FTP ..




                        Operation:
                                    Machine1’s Transport Layer divides the message (if necessary) into smaller chunks called segments.
                                    
                                    It adds a Transport Header containing source and destination port information (e.g., source port: 8080, destination port: 80 for HTTP).
                                    
                                    The Transport Layer also manages end-to-end error detection and control.
                                    
                                    The data is passed down to the Network Layer.
                        
                        Example: The message "Hello" could be divided into smaller packets (if it's a large message), and each packet gets a segment header with information about where the data should go.
                                    






        5. Network Layer (Layer 3)  


                this layer works for the  trasmission of recived Data Segments from one computer to another computer in diffrent Networks 


                Routers Works in this layer 

                the funtions of Network layer is :

                                        1.Logical Addressing ---> IPv4 and IPv6 

                                        2.Path Determination

                                        3.Routing

                
                Network layer Assingns Senders and receivers IP's to the each segment to form Packets


                *Routing :   

                        Routing is method of moving a packet from source to destination which is based upon the Logical Addressing with a Mask 


                        Lets say from computer B we are requsted to access "facebook.com", 

                        Now the facebook server replies back with packet to the Computer B , the packet should go to computer B with help of routing 


                        each device in a network must they possess unique IP .

                        facebook server already addedd sender and receiver IP in the packet .

                        in the mask the first 3 digits represents network and 4th represents host in a network 

                        Beased on the mask , the packet first goes to the network, then it goes to the host 



                Path Determination : 

                        choosig shorted path from sender to reciver for data delivery is called Path Determination

                                    L3 Device (Router) uses  OSPF , BGP and IS-IS to find best shortest path in the network

                    
                    Operation:
                            Machine1’s Network Layer adds a Network Header containing source and destination IP addresses.
                            
                            The Network Layer determines the best path for the data to travel and forwards it.
                            
                            The data is then passed to the Data Link Layer.
                    
                    Example: The IP header will indicate that the message is being sent from the source IP (e.g., 192.168.1.1) to the destination IP (e.g., 192.168.1.2).

            


            6. Data Link Layer (Layer 2):

                Physical Addressing is done at this layer 

                Physical Addressing: 

                    *MAC adress of Sender and reciver is added to the Incoming Packet to form Frame

                
                *Data Link layer is emmbended as a Software in NIC of a computer to transfer the Data via Media(medium like physical copper wires , cables or Wireless Air EM)(link)


                Data link layer perfoms two functions 

                Framing:
                        It allows Uppper layers of OSI models  to access the Medium 

                        Controls how data is placed and received from the medium --> Medium access  control  , 

                Role: The Data Link Layer is responsible for framing the data and managing access to the physical medium (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).
                
                Operation:
                            Machine1’s Data Link Layer adds a Data Link Header and Trailer (for error detection) to the data.
                            
                            The Data Link Layer creates a frame, which includes both the header (with source and destination MAC addresses) and the trailer (to check for transmission errors).
                            
                            The data is passed to the Physical Layer for transmission.
                
                Example: The frame will contain the MAC address of Machine1 (sender) and Machine2 (receiver), and if there’s a transmission error, the trailer helps to detect that.

            


            7. Physical Layer (Layer 1)
                                        Role: The Physical Layer is responsible for the actual transmission of raw bits over the physical medium, such as cables, wireless signals, etc.
                                        
                                        Operation:
                                                    Machine1’s Physical Layer converts the data into electrical signals, light pulses, or radio waves (depending on the medium).
                                                    
                                                    These signals are transmitted to the network and carried over the physical medium to the receiver.
                                        
                                        Example: The frame is converted into electrical signals (if using copper cables) or radio waves (if using Wi-Fi) and transmitted across the network.

















Receiver Perspective:
            On the receiver side, each layer performs the reverse operation to reconstruct the original message.

            1. Physical Layer (Layer 1)
            Operation:
            Machine2’s Physical Layer receives the electrical signals, light pulses, or radio waves sent by Machine1.
            It converts these signals back into binary data (1s and 0s).
            Example: The signals are converted back into a binary format that can be processed by the next layer.
            
            
            2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
            Operation:
            Machine2’s Data Link Layer receives the frame from the Physical Layer.
            It checks the Data Link Trailer for error detection (e.g., CRC check) and removes the Data Link Header and Trailer.
            The data is passed up to the Network Layer.
            Example: The frame is checked for errors, and if everything is correct, the MAC headers are stripped off, leaving the packet.
            
            
            
            3. Network Layer (Layer 3)
            Operation:
            Machine2’s Network Layer removes the Network Header and extracts the data (the packet).
            It checks if the data is destined for Machine2 based on the destination IP address.
            The data is passed up to the Transport Layer.
            Example: The packet header is stripped off, and the remaining data is handed to the Transport Layer.
            
            
            
            4. Transport Layer (Layer 4)
            Operation:
            Machine2’s Transport Layer removes the Transport Header (which contains source/destination port information).
            It ensures that all segments are properly reassembled to reconstruct the original message.
            The data is passed up to the Session Layer.
            Example: The segments are reassembled into the complete message ("Hello"), and the transport header is discarded.
            
            
            
            5. Session Layer (Layer 5)
            Operation:
            Machine2’s Session Layer ensures that the session between Machine1 and Machine2 is properly maintained.
            It does not modify the data but ensures the session is synchronized.
            The data is passed up to the Presentation Layer.
            Example: If the session is active and no other session changes are needed, the session header is stripped and the data ("Hello") is passed on.
           
           
           
            6. Presentation Layer (Layer 6)
            Operation:
            Machine2’s Presentation Layer may decrypt, decompress, or decode the data.
            If encryption or compression was applied, this layer reverses those operations.
            It transforms the data back into a readable format and passes it to the Application Layer.
            Example: If "Hello" was encrypted or compressed, this layer will convert it back to its original form ("Hello").
            
            
            
            7. Application Layer (Layer 7)
            Operation:
            Machine2’s Application Layer receives the data ("Hello") and presents it to the user.
            The data is now ready for the application (e.g., a messaging app).
            Example: The user sees the message "Hello" on their screen.
