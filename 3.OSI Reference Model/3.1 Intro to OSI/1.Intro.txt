In the early days, computer manufacturers developed their own networking Protocols for communication between their devices.

Example:
        Dell developed its own protocols → Dell1, Dell2
        
        Lenovo developed its own protocols → Lenovo1, Lenovo2

    If Dell1 communicates with Dell2, there is no issue since both follow the same protocol.
    
    However, if Dell1 tries to communicate with Lenovo1, it fails because they use different protocol stacks that are incompatible with each other.



Why OSI Was Introduced:
                    *To solve this issue, ISO (International Organization for Standardization) introduced the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, which defines a standardized framework for communication.

Purpose of OSI:
                *Provides a standardized communication model that all manufacturers must follow.
                
                Ensures seamless communication between different systems, regardless of their underlying protocols.
                
                Breaks down communication into 7 layers, each handling a specific function.

    By following the OSI model, any computer or network device—whether from Dell, Lenovo, HP, Cisco, or any other manufacturer—can communicate without compatibility issues.




why OSI model or framework is called as "Reference model"? 

    After the OSI model was introduced, the TCP/IP model became widely adopted.
    
    TCP/IP is not an updated version of OSI but rather a simplified and practical model that was already in development before OSI.
    
    Since TCP/IP became the standard for real-world networking, most manufacturers migrated to TCP/IP, and the OSI model remained primarily a reference model rather than an actual working framework.










Working of  OSI :   

    OSI Model gives  you a clear understanding of how data flows through Network 
        
        Each layer is a "Package of Protocols" which decides the folow of Data in the network to maitain seamless Commmunication

                                            Application Layer  ----------------> L7


                                            Presentation Layer  ----------------> L6


                                            Session Layer  ---------------------> L5


                                            Trasport  Layer  ------------------> L4


                                            Network Layer  --------------------> L3


                                            Data Link Layer  ------------------> L2


                                            Physical Layer  -------------------> L1

        

        *Application Layer is always Layer7 , it is never ever L1 , when some say it is layer1 is it wrong. 


        Application Layer , Presentation Layer and Session Layer is called "Upper layer" ----> P2

        Remaing Layers are Lower layers-----> P3
        



        Hub is called as Physical layer(L1) device    -----> P4

        Switch is called as Data Link Layer(L2) device -->  P4

        Router is called as Network Layer(L3) Device  --> P4




        * Data Link Layer and Network layer got some "Addressing" skills:

                            Network Layer Address--- > IP Address (L3 address)

                            Data Link Layer ---->      MAC addres (L2 addres)
