Group of Computers or devices interconnected to each other is calles a Network


* The Process of crareting Network is called Networking.

        Components of a Network:
            1.End Device ---Computer , Mobile
            2.NIC
            3.Media
            4.Connecting Device 
















-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NIC: Contains Burnt-in-address/MAC address/L2 address/hardware address / Physical address/ MAC-48 bit (12 hexa) address burnt into the NIC at the time of manufacturing and is stored in the read-only memory (ROM) of the NIC. 

    The MAC address is called a Burnt-in Address (BIA) because it is permanently assigned to a Network Interface Card (NIC) during the manufacturing process and is stored in the read-only memory (ROM) of the NIC. This means the address is "burnt" into the hardware and cannot be changed (though some software-based modifications are possible).

            
            A MAC address is a 48-bit hexadecimal number represented in 12 hexadecimal digits(one Hexa Decimal number is 4 bit--> 48bits /4 =12 hexadecimal numbers) (6 bytes)(when some asks or if you want to send , we can not say 0 0 0 0 1.... so we use hexadecimal form to represent it easily):

                    Ex: 001A . 2B3C . 4D5E

                                or

                        00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E


                Here:

                    00:1A:2B(6digits --> 24 bits) → Manufacturer's unique ID (Organizationally Unique Identifier - OUI) provided by Institue of Electrical and Electronics Engineers - IEEE
                    3C:4D:5E → Device-specific identifier or Vendor assigned like samsung galaxy ....

Transmission: 
        Transmission Types ----> P7
        Transmission  Modes ---> P8
        Transmission methods --->P9



    In networking, Transmission refers to the process of sending data from one device to another over a communication medium. It can be classified into three main categories:

                Transmission Types – Defines whether data is sent as a continuous stream or in separate packets.
                
                Transmission Modes – Defines the direction in which data flows between sender and receiver.
                
                Transmission Methods – Defines how multiple devices share a communication channel.
    Let’s break down each one in detail.




    1️⃣ Transmission Types (Based on Data Transfer Format)----->P7
                This refers to how data is transferred over a network.

                (A) Analog Transmission
                            Data is sent in the form of continuous signals (waves).
                            
                            Used in radio, TV broadcasts, telephone lines.
                            
                            Example: FM/AM radio signals.
                
                (B) Digital Transmission
                            Data is sent in the form of binary signals (0s and 1s).
                            
                            Used in computers, fiber-optic networks, Ethernet.
                            
                            Example: Sending data over the internet.











    2️⃣ Transmission Modes (Based on Data Flow Direction)
            Transmission modes define how data flows between sender and receiver.

                    (A) Simplex Mode
                            Data flows in one direction only.
                            
                            The sender only transmits, and the receiver only receives.
                            
                            Example: TV Broadcast, Radio Signal, Keyboard input.
                            
                            📌 Analogy: Watching a live football match on TV → You receive the signal but cannot send anything back.


            (B) Half-Duplex Mode
                            Data flows in both directions, but only one device can send at a time.
                            
                            Example: Walkie-talkie, Two-way radios.
                            
                                📌 Analogy: A walkie-talkie → You press a button to talk, then release it to listen.


            (C) Full-Duplex Mode
                            Data flows in both directions simultaneously.
                            
                            Used in real-time communication like telephones and video calls.
                            
                            Example: Telephone call, Internet chat.
                                
                            📌 Analogy: A phone call → Both people can talk and listen at the same time.




    3️⃣ Transmission Methods (Based on Channel Sharing)
                These methods define how multiple devices share a single communication channel.

                    (A) Unicast      1-->1
                                Data is sent from one sender to one receiver.
                                
                                Example: Downloading a file, Browsing a website.
                                
                                📌 Analogy: Sending a private message to a friend.

                    
                    
                    (B) Broadcast     1-->All
                                Data is sent from one sender to all devices in the network.
                                
                                Example: TV broadcasting, ARP request in networking.
                                
                                📌 Analogy: A radio station broadcasting music to all listeners.



                    (C) Multicast    1---> Many(a group)
                                Data is sent from one sender to a specific group of receivers.
                                
                                Example: Online streaming services like YouTube Live, Video conferencing.
                                
                                📌 Analogy: A teacher giving an online class to a selected group of students.

Final Thought 💡
    Transmission in networking is about how data is sent, received, and shared between devices. Each type plays a crucial role in internet communication, networking, and broadcasting.

****🔹 What is "Bandwidth" in General Terms?

        Bandwidth is the maximum capacity of something to carry or transfer information, energy, or material over time.

        💡 Think of it as "how much can be handled at once."

        For example:

                A water pipe’s bandwidth is how much water it can carry per second.
                
                A highway’s bandwidth is how many cars can travel on it at once.
                
                A brain’s bandwidth refers to how much information it can process at a time.


        
        🔹 What is the Main Purpose of Bandwidth?
                
                The purpose of bandwidth is to determine how much data, energy, or material can flow through a system efficiently.

                📌 Why is this important?

                        More bandwidth = More data can move at the same time.
                        
                        Less bandwidth = Slower data transfer or bottlenecks.
        


        🔹 Why is it Called "Bandwidth"?
                The term "bandwidth" comes from physics and engineering.

                "Band" refers to a range of frequencies in a signal.
                
                "Width" refers to how large that range is.
                
                A wider frequency range allows more data to pass through at the same time.
            
            🔹 Over time, the term "bandwidth" was used for digital communication to mean "how much data can move per second."
            
    




        📡 What is Bandwidth in Networking?

            In networking, bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over a network connection in a given time.

            📌 Measured in:

                    Bits per second (bps)
                    Kilobits per second (Kbps)
                    Megabits per second (Mbps)
                    Gigabits per second (Gbps)
        
            🔹 Example:

                A 1Gbps (Gigabit per second) connection can send 1 billion bits of data per second.
        


        🔹 Examples of Bandwidth in Networking

                Example 1: Internet Speed Plans

                            Imagine you are choosing an internet plan:

                                100 Mbps plan → Can handle basic browsing & streaming on a few devices.
                                
                                1 Gbps (1000 Mbps) plan → Can handle gaming, 4K streaming, and multiple users.

                    Higher bandwidth = More devices can use the internet smoothly at the same time.

                

                Example 2: Downloading a File
                        You want to download a 1GB movie:

                            With 100 Mbps bandwidth → Takes 80 seconds.
                            With 10 Mbps bandwidth → Takes 800 seconds (over 13 minutes).
                        
                        📌 More bandwidth = Faster downloads.
                


                Example 3: Video Streaming (YouTube, Netflix, etc.)
                
                        480p (SD video) → Needs 1.5 Mbps bandwidth.
                        1080p (Full HD video) → Needs 5 Mbps bandwidth.
                        4K (Ultra HD video) → Needs 25 Mbps bandwidth.
                    
                    📌 If your bandwidth is low, the video will buffer (load slowly).

    


    ***🔴Best Analogy:You can definitely think of bandwidth like a valve attached to a pipe.

                ✅ Even if the water pressure (internet speed) is high, if the valve (bandwidth) is narrow, only a small amount of water (data) can pass through at a time.
            

        🔹 Breaking It Down:

                    --> Water pipe = Network connection
                    
                    --> Water pressure = Potential internet speed (how fast data could flow)
                    
                    --> Valve size = Bandwidth (how much data actually flows)
                    
                    --> More open valve = More water (data) flows
                    
                    --> Smaller valve = Less water (data) flows, even if pressure is high
        


        🔹 Example 1: High-Speed Internet with Low Bandwidth
                    
                    Imagine your ISP gives you 1 Gbps internet speed, but your Wi-Fi router only supports 100 Mbps bandwidth.
                    
                    ➡️ Your internet feels slow because the "valve" (router) is limiting the flow of data.
        

        🔹 Example 2: Fiber Optic vs. Old Copper Cable
                    
                    Fiber optic cables have a wide valve (high bandwidth), allowing huge amounts of data to flow.
                    
                    Old copper cables have a narrow valve (low bandwidth), restricting data flow, even if the internet provider offers high speed.
            
        

        🔹 Example 3: Watching 4K Videos on a Slow Network
                    
                    You try to stream a 4K video (which needs 25 Mbps) but your bandwidth is only 10 Mbps.
                    
                    ➡️ Result? The video buffers, just like a narrow valve slowing down water flow.
        

    💡 Final Thought:
                    Yes! Bandwidth is like a valve on a pipe—no matter how strong the pressure (internet speed) is, the flow (data transfer) depends on how wide or narrow the valve (bandwidth) is.
        



**🔴what are the network devices posses this band width ?

        Many network devices control or affect bandwidth in a network. These devices determine how much data can flow through at a time, just like valves in a water system.

            🔹 Network Devices That Possess Bandwidth:

                        1️⃣ Modem 🖧 (Modulator-Demodulator)
                                📌 What it does:

                                        Connects your home to the Internet Service Provider (ISP).
                                        
                                        Converts digital data (your computer) ↔️ analog signals (for transmission).
                                
                                
                                📌 Bandwidth Control:

                                            Limited by ISP's Plan (e.g., 100 Mbps, 500 Mbps, 1 Gbps).
                                            
                                            Older modems have lower bandwidth capacity (e.g., old DSL modems < 10 Mbps).
                        
                        
                        
                        2️⃣ Router 📡 (Traffic Controller)
                                    📌 What it does:

                                            Distributes internet bandwidth to different devices (phones, laptops, smart TVs).
                                            
                                            Acts like a network manager for a home or office.
                                    
                                    
                                    📌 Bandwidth Control:

                                            Wi-Fi 5 Routers = Up to 1 Gbps
                                            
                                            Wi-Fi 6 Routers = Up to 10 Gbps
                                            
                                            Cheap routers have lower bandwidth and can bottleneck high-speed internet.
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    🔹 Example:
                                            Even if you have 1 Gbps internet, if your router supports only 100 Mbps, you can only use 100 Mbps max.
                            
                        

                        3️⃣ Switch 🔀 (Smart Distributor)
                                📌 What it does:

                                        Used in offices, data centers to connect multiple computers.
                                        
                                        Distributes bandwidth efficiently to connected devices.
                                


                                📌 Bandwidth Control:

                                        Old switches: 10/100 Mbps
                                        
                                        Modern switches: 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, 100 Gbps
                                        
                                        Managed switches can prioritize bandwidth for certain devices (e.g., servers).
                                


                                🔹 Example:
                                        If 10 users are connected to a 1 Gbps switch, each might get 100 Mbps, depending on usage.
                        


                        4️⃣ Hub 📥📤 (Dumb Repeater – Worst for Bandwidth)
                                    📌 What it does:

                                                Broadcasts data to ALL devices instead of sending it only to the correct one.
                                                
                                                Wastes bandwidth because every device receives all data packets, even if they are not needed.
                                    
                                    
                                    📌 Bandwidth Control:

                                                Very inefficient because of unnecessary traffic.
                                    
                                    
                                    Example: If a hub has 4 devices and 100 Mbps bandwidth, all 4 devices share it equally, even if only one is active.
                                                
                                                🔹 Modern networks use switches instead of hubs for better bandwidth management.

                        

                        5️⃣ Access Point (AP) 📶 (Wi-Fi Booster)
                                        📌 What it does:

                                                    Extends Wi-Fi coverage in large offices, malls, airports.
                                                    
                                                    Helps more devices connect without losing speed.
                                        
                                        📌 Bandwidth Control:

                                                    Modern APs support 1 Gbps to 10 Gbps Wi-Fi speeds.
                                                    
                                                    Older APs may slow down networks due to limited bandwidth.
                                        
                                        🔹 Example: If too many people use an access point, bandwidth is shared, making Wi-Fi slower.
                        


                        6️⃣ Network Interface Card (NIC) 🖥️ (Your Device’s Network Port)
                                        📌 What it does:

                                                    Physical or Wi-Fi card that connects your device (PC, laptop) to a network.
                                                    
                                                    Determines maximum bandwidth your device can handle.
                                        
                                        📌 Bandwidth Control:

                                                        Old NICs → 100 Mbps
                                                       
                                                        Modern NICs → 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, even 100 Gbps
                                        
                                        🔹 Example:
                                                    If you have a 1 Gbps internet plan but your NIC supports only 100 Mbps, you’ll be limited to 100 Mbps.
                        



                        7️⃣ Firewall 🔥 (Security + Bandwidth Manager)
                                        📌 What it does:

                                                    Protects networks by blocking threats and managing data flow.
                                                    
                                                    Can limit bandwidth usage for certain types of traffic (e.g., video streaming).
                                        
                                        📌 Bandwidth Control:

                                                    Some firewalls slow down networks due to high processing needs.
                                                    
                                                    Modern firewalls can handle 1-100 Gbps without reducing speed.
                                        
                                        
                                        🔹 Example:
                                                    If a company restricts YouTube to 5 Mbps per user, the firewall limits bandwidth usage for YouTube while keeping other tasks fast.
                    



                    🔴🔹 Final Analogy: Water Pipe System 🚰
                                    Imagine a water distribution system where:

                                                Modem = Main water supply (from ISP).
                                                
                                                Router = Water tank (distributes water to different rooms).
                                                
                                                Switch = Pipes to different floors (smartly directs water where needed).
                                                
                                                Hub = Leaking pipe (wastes water by sending it everywhere).
                                                
                                                Access Point = Extra taps (Wi-Fi expansion).
                                                
                                                NIC = Faucet (determines how much water your device gets).
                                                
                                                Firewall = Filter (blocks harmful substances & limits water flow).
                                        
                                        📌 Just like water pipes control flow, network devices control bandwidth!




        🔹 Final Takeaways
                1️⃣ All network devices have bandwidth limitations based on their hardware & technology.
                
                2️⃣ Older devices may limit network speeds even if your internet is fast.
                
                3️⃣ Upgrading key devices (like router, switch, NIC) can unlock full bandwidth potential.
                
                4️⃣ Managing bandwidth smartly (e.g., using a switch instead of a hub) improves network performance.









                









🔴Why?
        Storage & File Sizes are always measured in bytes (B).
        
        Network Speed & Data Transfer Rates are measured in bits per second (bps).
        
        Conversion:
            1 GB (Gigabyte) = 8 Gigabits (Gb)
            
            So, 3GB = 24 Gigabits (Gb)

        If you're downloading the movie on a 100 Mbps connection:

            100 Mbps = 12.5 MBps (Megabytes per second)
            
            3GB (3000 MB) ÷ 12.5 MBps ≈ 240 seconds (4 minutes)
            
            So, your 3GB movie is in bytes, but when transferring over a network, you may need to convert it to bits.

Connecting Device:
       
we can setup Direct connection with one Computer to another Computer using NIC (Network).  but if want to setup extra connection for same Computer you need another NIC. So for each connection you need that many NIC's for single Computer (P2.png)

So to aviod this Complication we can use a In betwwen  Device(Network Device) which has multiple Interfaces(ports). this Device will forward the incomming Data each peer in the Network
 
So all the Computer can send Data to each other using that In b/w Device (P3).  and the Device is called "Connecting Device".


Examples of Connecting Device: 

                    Hub

                    Switch


Here a media or mediaum can be a Physical  Wire , wirelesss ..




we can Configure the Connecting Device such a way that we can control the connections b/w the peers.

     Example: Computer1 should not talk with Computer3 
             
             Computer4 can send data with Computer2 .....





Hub: P18

    Physical Layer Device 

    Regenarates the Signal

    has less fewer number of ports

    "Bandwidth Sharing: The interfaces of a hub do not have a fixed bandwidth per port. Instead, the total available bandwidth is shared among all connected devices, meaning each device gets a portion of the bandwidth whenever data is transmitted."

    *Bigest Dis-advantage: Signal broadcasting (including Source Interface): Hub works on NO LOGiC , If any sender wants to send to the other peer in the Network it will broadcast the entire entire peers in the network eventhough "It will again send it to the sender".---> P19

        that's why it is called Non -Inteligence device

        🔹 Example: Hub Broadcasting Data to All Devices (Including Sender)
                    
                    Scenario: Office Network with a Hub
                    
                    Imagine a small office network with a hub connecting four computers:

                            PC1 (192.168.1.1)
                            PC2 (192.168.1.2)
                            PC3 (192.168.1.3)
                            PC4 (192.168.1.4)

                    Now, suppose PC1 wants to send a file to PC3.

                    Step-by-Step Process in a Hub-Based Network

                        1.PC1 sends data to PC3.
                        
                        2.The hub receives the data but does NOT know which port PC3 is connected to.
                        
                        3.Instead of sending data only to PC3, the hub broadcasts the data to ALL devices (PC2, PC3, PC4).
                        
                        4.PC3 accepts the data because it is the intended recipient.
                        
                        5.PC1 also receives the data back, even though it was the sender.
