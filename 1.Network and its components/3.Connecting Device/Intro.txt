Connecting Device:
       
we can setup Direct connection with one Computer to another Computer using NIC (Network).  but if want to setup extra connection for same Computer you need another NIC. So for each connection you need that many NIC's for single Computer (P2.png)

So to aviod this Complication we can use a In betwwen  Device(Network Device) which has multiple Interfaces(ports). this Device will forward the incomming Data each peer in the Network
 
So all the Computer can send Data to each other using that In b/w Device (P3).  and the Device is called "Connecting Device".


Examples of Connecting Device: 

                    Hub

                    Switch


Here a media or mediaum can be a Physical  Wire , wirelesss ..




we can Configure the Connecting Device such a way that we can control the connections b/w the peers.

     Example: Computer1 should not talk with Computer3 
             
             Computer4 can send data with Computer2 .....





Hub: P18

    Physical Layer Device 

    Regenarates the Signal

    has less fewer number of ports

    "Bandwidth Sharing: The interfaces of a hub do not have a fixed bandwidth per port. Instead, the total available bandwidth is shared among all connected devices, meaning each device gets a portion of the bandwidth whenever data is transmitted."

    *Bigest Dis-advantage: Signal broadcasting (including Source Interface): Hub works on NO LOGiC , If any sender wants to send to the other peer in the Network it will broadcast the entire entire peers in the network eventhough "It will again send it to the sender".---> P19

        that's why it is called Non -Inteligence device

        ðŸ”¹ Example: Hub Broadcasting Data to All Devices (Including Sender)
                    
                    Scenario: Office Network with a Hub
                    
                    Imagine a small office network with a hub connecting four computers:

                            PC1 (192.168.1.1)
                            PC2 (192.168.1.2)
                            PC3 (192.168.1.3)
                            PC4 (192.168.1.4)

                    Now, suppose PC1 wants to send a file to PC3.

                    Step-by-Step Process in a Hub-Based Network

                        1.PC1 sends data to PC3.
                        
                        2.The hub receives the data but does NOT know which port PC3 is connected to.
                        
                        3.Instead of sending data only to PC3, the hub broadcasts the data to ALL devices (PC2, PC3, PC4).
                        
                        4.PC3 accepts the data because it is the intended recipient.
                        
                        5.PC1 also receives the data back, even though it was the sender.
    






Switch :
        Layer 2 Device --> Data Layer (P21)

        Signal Regenarates

        No unnecessary Broadcast


        *Inteligence Device -----unlike hub which is Dumb


        perfomce signal flooding- when required ---> During the Broadcast send the data to others excepts the source 


        Contains ASIC Applictaion Specific Integrated Circuit ---> which contains some intellegence






Router: L3 Device P22

        used to connect diffrent Network *23
                Ex: using Internet , connectting from one network to another network
        
        minimum it should have to interfaces 
        











Firewall:P24


Modem:
        perfoms Modulation and De-modulatio of Digital Signals from compute to via anolog lines 


        Modren Modems are Router + Switch + Firewall + Access Point


Access Point: which trasmitts the wirelesss signls(EM waves) ,so that you can connect to network ----> it is like they can crate a wirelesss medium so that you can access the network





End Point Device:
        machine acting as end device like laptop ,Desktop , Mobile so...


Server: 
        Powefull computer taht provides various shared resources or services

        eg: DHCP
        DNS 
        WDS windows Deplyment server
        FTP server 









apart from the these devices , there are lot of  network devices like WLC, NG_IPS ...
